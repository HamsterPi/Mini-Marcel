# Mini-Marcel
Modified 'Marcel' baseball data projection algorithm that predicts offensive results of Major League Baseball players for the 2019 season using data collected from the 2016-2018 seasons. Results were then fed into R and K-means clustering was employed to produce relevant graphs comparing the projected data to that of the previous years'. My projections exceeded expectations and esults achieved 0.80 confidence. A document detailing the entire process can be found in the 'docs' directory.
